  <h3>ShakeAlert - PENDING</h3>
  <p>
    The Earthquake Early Warning System registered signals consistent with a
    felt earthquake; real earthquakes will be detected by the seismic network
    and reported here; watch for updates. If you do not see a match in a few
    minutes, there may have been a problem, and we are investigating. For EEW
    events smaller than M5.0, the investigation and update could be on the next
    business day.
