<h2>Felt Report - Tell Us!</h2>

<p>
  By contributing your experience of the earthquake, either immediately
  afterward, or whenever it is possible for you to do so, you make a
  contribution to the scientific body of information about each earthquake. You
  also ensure that your area has been represented in the compilation of the maps
  of shaking. This is a two-way street: not only will you add valuable
  information on the extent of ground shaking and damage, but in the process we
  hope you will learn more about how other communities fared and gain a greater
  understanding of the effects of earthquakes.
